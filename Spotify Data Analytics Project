# For this project, I was given Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 




#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )


#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined if more energetic songs tend to be more popular 

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(energy), 3) AS avg_energy,
  ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Second, I determined if instrumental tracks are generally less popular 

SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN instrumentalness > 0.5 THEN 'Instrumental'
    ELSE 'Vocal'
  END AS track_type,
  ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_type;

Then I determined what audio features best describe the top 10 most popular songs

SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(danceability), 3) AS avg_danceability,
  ROUND(AVG(energy), 3) AS avg_energy,
  ROUND(AVG(valence), 3) AS avg_valence,
  ROUND(AVG(tempo), 2) AS avg_tempo
FROM (
  SELECT *
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 10
) top_songs;

Finally, I determined if longer songs tend to be more or less popular?

SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN duration_ms < 180000 THEN 'Short (<3 min)'
    WHEN duration_ms < 300000 THEN 'Medium (3–5 min)'
    ELSE 'Long (>5 min)'
  END AS song_length,
  ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_length;
